# Simple Puzzle Platformer Prototype

This is a small project to create a simple game as a **prototype** for a more complex one I plan to develop in the future. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use the Bevy engine and to create a template for puzzle platformers featuring a linear leveling system.

## Features

- Simple puzzle platformer mechanics
- Linear level progression
- Bevy engine as the game framework

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to explore the Bevy engine and get hands-on experience building a game. Additionally, it serves as a foundation for future, more advanced puzzle platformers, with plans to expand on the gameplay, art, and level design.
